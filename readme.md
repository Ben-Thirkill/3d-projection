This is a proof of concept of the use of voxels and matrices in order to render a 3D Object using nothing but a matrix math library. 
This is to go along with my Computer Science A-Level ray-casting project as a proof of concept of another form of 3D Graphics.

I used VB.Net shape drawing and a Matrix library to get this to work, nothing else. 

Here take a look for yourself!

The code will sadly not be published until the project is marked and secured under my name.
